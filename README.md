## Ethics Statement

We recognize that drones can have a very negative ethical implication, especially when associated with military technology. This technology is especially relevant right now considering the Ukraine crisis, and new innovations such as the [Elbit Lanius](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/18/killer-racing-drone-weapons/) could be perceived to have similar technology to what we are working on. We want to be clear in differentiating the technology that we are working on from the technology used in weaponized drones.

We believe that the technology we are working on has a direct application in factory and automation for industry, as our project is designed to work in a very controlled environment. For example, our system relies on april tag fiducial markers to allow the drone to operate indoors. Any attempt to use our system for indoor localization on (for example) a battlefield would require a completely different technology. We also believe that by operating indoors in a very controlled environment, we reduce (if not completely remove) any possible invasion of privacy that a drone with a camera can cause, and we donâ€™t intend to implement person- or face- recognition. 

Finally, with any drone, there is the potential for injury to people as a result of a malfunction. We hope to reduce this by implementing propeller guards that prevent contact with the propellers in the event that something goes wrong. Our project code is available on github and we will be publishing details about our system online so theoretically people can recreate it.
